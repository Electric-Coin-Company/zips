            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a href="#rfc2119" id="id1" class="footnote_reference">2</a></p>
            <p>For clarity this ZIP defines these terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mining software in the context of this ZIP refers to pool software, local mining software, or staking software.</li>
                <li>Mining is defined as the action of processing transactions, so this would include proof of stake, if Zcash would switch to that.</li>
                <li>Mining coins transferred via fees are considered rewards (infinite), coins generated via block generation are considered distribution (finite).</li>
                <li>Block distribution is defined as the block reward minus transaction fees. <span class="editor-note">the protocol specification uses "block subsidy".</span></li>
                <li>Spirit is defined as what is the intended outcome of the ZIP. <a href="#spirit" id="id2" class="footnote_reference">1</a></li>
                <li>Initial promise is non-neutral language referencing the block distribution rules as initially set out. <a href="#funding" id="id3" class="footnote_reference">3</a></li>
            </ul>

                        <td>If there is contradiction between Spirit and any other part of the proposal that needs to be addressed, in the event it is not addressed Spirit is assumed to overrule all.</td>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The spirit of this ZIP is to is to ensure that the Founders’ Reward ends. It is not the intention of this ZIP to stop protocol-based donations.</p>
            <p>It is a simple short ZIP.</p>
            <p>Hopefully it will be compatible with a number of other ZIPs and can be worked into them.</p>

            <h2>Out of Scope for this Proposal</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Governance on how decisions are made; this ZIP is not meant to be used as a form of governance.</li>
                <li>Future funding.</li>
                <li>It does not cover other donations or revenue streams.</li>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Founders’ Reward is set to expire in 2020.</li>
                <li>To honour the initial promise of giving 90% of total block distribution to miners. Therefore the protocol will give them 100% of the block distribution after the first halving.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="requirements">
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Founders’ Reward MUST end at the first halving in October 2020.</li>
                <li>This ZIP does not preclude the Electric Coin Company from sourcing funding elsewhere, or from donations.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="specification">
            <h2>Specification</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The existing Founders’ Reward consensus rules <a href="#spec-subsidies" id="id4" class="footnote_reference">4</a> <a href="#spec-foundersreward" id="id5" class="footnote_reference">5</a> MUST be preserved.</li>
                <li>Specifically, <code>FoundersReward(height)</code> MUST equal <code>0</code> if <code>Halving(height) &gt;= 1</code>. (For clarity once the halving happens the Founders’ Reward stops, as per the rules outlined in <a href="#spec-subsidies" id="id6" class="footnote_reference">4</a> and <a href="#spec-foundersreward" id="id7" class="footnote_reference">5</a>.)</li>
                <li>This specification is only meant to stop the Founders’ Reward, not protocol-based donations.</li>
                <li>Enforcing some kind of mandatory donation via whatever mechanism would be seen as continuation of the Founders’ Reward.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implications to other users</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Block distribution payouts to Founders’ Reward addresses will cease at the first halving.</li>
                <li>Pools and other software need to take this into account.</li>
