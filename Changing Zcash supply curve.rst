Out of Scope for this proposal
==============================

Everything except Zcash supply curve.

Abstract
========

High inflation is jeopardizing Zcash SoV proposition. Zcash will maintain comparatively high inflation after 2020 halving.
Halvings introduce supply shocks that should be avoided on payment networks.

Motivation

Requirements

Change Zcash emission schedule.


Specification
=============

After the 2020 halving; change Zcash issuance to consistent 3% yearly inflation (no more halvings) until remainder of 21 million ZEC supplyâ€™s exhausted.

 
Raised objections and issues so far
===================================

-  The author acknowledges that this proposal might be controversial, and may need further qualification on the numbers.
-  Impact of this zip to the economics of zcash is unknown and non trivial.
-  The code changes to make this happen are non trivial.

Implications to other users
===========================

-  The knock on impact of this zip to exchanges and wallet developers maybe non trivial.
-  The economics of doing this have not been calculated.
