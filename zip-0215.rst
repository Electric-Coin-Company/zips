Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", "RECOMMENDED",
"OPTIONAL", and "REQUIRED" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

Abstract
========

Zcash uses Ed25519 signatures as part of Sprout transactions.  However, Ed25519
does not clearly define criteria for signature validity, and RFC-conformant
implementations need not agree on whether signatures are valid.  This is
unacceptable for a consensus-critical application like Zcash.  Currently, Zcash
inherits criteria for signature verification from an obsolete version of
`libsodium`.  Instead, this ZIP clears the situation by explicitly defining the
Ed25519 verification criteria and changing them to be compatible with batch
verification.

Motivation
==========

The lack of clear verification criteria for Ed25519 signatures poses a
maintenance burden.  Zcash inherited precise validation criteria from a
then-current version of `libsodium` (1.0.15).  However, `libsodium` never
guaranteed stable validation criteria, and changed behavior in a later point
release.  This forced `zcashd` to use an older version of the library before
eventually patching a newer version to have consistent validation criteria.  An
attempt was made to encode these criteria into the Zcash specification, but the
specification did not match the `libsodium` behavior, and had to be updated.
To be compatible, Zebra had to implement a special library, `ed25519-zebra` to
provide Zcash-flavored Ed25519, attempting to match `libsodium` exactly.  And
the initial attempt to implement `ed25519-zebra` was also incompatible, because
it precisely matched the wrong compile-time configuration of `libsodium`.

In addition, the validation criteria used by Zcash preclude the use of batch
verification of Ed25519 signatures.  While signature verification is not the
primary bottleneck for Zcash, it would be nice to be able to batch-verify
signatures, as is the case for RedJubJub.

Specification
=============

After activation of this ZIP, the `JoinSplitSig` validation rules are changed to the following:

- `R` MUST be the encoding of a point on the Edwards form of Curve25519 (non-canonical encodings are allowed, as now);
- `s` MUST represent an integer less than `l`;
- The group equation `[8][s]B = [8]R + [8][k]A` MUST be satisfied, where `k` and `A` are as defined in RFC 8032 ยง5.1.7.

The language about `ExcludedPointEncodings` in ยง5.4.5 of the Zcash specification is deleted.

Rationale
=========

This change simplifies the Ed25519 validation logic and reduces future
maintenance burden.  It also allows the use of batch verification.  Because
multiplication by the cofactor admits more solutions to the verification
equation, not fewer, it is compatible with all existing Ed25519 signatures on
the chain.  

Security and Privacy Considerations
===================================

This change has no effect on honestly-generated signatures.
