            <p>This ZIP specifies modifications to the Zcash block header semantics and consensus rules in order to support the probabilistic verification FlyClient protocol <a id="id3" class="footnote_reference" href="#flyclient">2</a>. The <code>hashFinalSaplingRoot</code> commitment in the block header is replaced with a commitment to the root of a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR), that in turn commits to various features of the chain's history, including the Sapling commitment tree.</p>

            <p>An MMR is a Merkle tree which allows for efficient appends, proofs, and verifications. Informally, appending data to an MMR consists of creating a new leaf and then iteratively merging neighboring subtrees with the same size. This takes at most
                <span class="math">\(\log(n)\)</span>
             operations and only requires knowledge of the previous subtree roots, of which there are fewer than
                <span class="math">\(\log(n)\)</span>
            .</p>
            <p>(example adapted from <a id="id4" class="footnote_reference" href="#mimblewimble">6</a>) To illustrate this, consider a list of 11 leaves. We first construct the biggest perfect binary subtrees possible by joining any balanced sibling trees that are the same size. We do this starting from the left to the right, adding a parent as soon as 2 children exist. This leaves us with three subtrees ("mountains") of altitudes 3, 1, and 0:</p>
            <pre data-language="text">   /\
  /  \
 /\  /\
/\/\/\/\ /\ /</pre>
            <p>Note that the first leftmost peak is always the highest. We can number this structure in the order by which nodes would be created, if the leaves were inserted from left to right:</p>

            <p>Let
                <span class="math">\(h\)</span>
             be the altitude of a given node. We can easily jump to the node's right sibling (if it has one) by adding
                <span class="math">\(2^{h+1} - 1\)</span>
             to its position, and its left child (if it has one) by subtracting
                <span class="math">\(2^h\)</span>
            . This allows us to efficiently find the subtree roots ("peaks") of the mountains.</p>
            <p>Once we have the positions of the mountain peaks, we "bag" them using the following algorithm:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Generate a node connecting the 2 left-most peaks, forming a new peak.</li>
                <li>Repeat 1. until we have a single peak.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note that the extra nodes generated during the bagging process do not follow the above rules for jumping between nodes.</p>

            <p>MMR trees allow for efficient incremental set update operations (push, pop, prune). In addition, MMR update operations and Merkle proofs for recent additions to the leaf set are more efficient than other incremental Merkle tree implementations (e.g. Bitcoin's padded leafset, sparse Merkle trees, and Zcash's incremental note commitment trees).</p>

            <p>MMR proofs are used in the FlyClient protocol <a id="id5" class="footnote_reference" href="#flyclient">2</a>, to reduce the proof size needed for light clients to verify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the validity of a block chain received from a full node, and</li>
                <li>the inclusion of a block
                    <span class="math">\(B\)</span>
                 in that chain, and</li>
                <li>certain metadata of any block or range of blocks in that chain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The protocol requires that an MMR that commits to the inclusion of all blocks since the preceding network upgrade
                <span class="math">\((B_x, \ldots, B_{n-1})\)</span>
             is formed for each block
                <span class="math">\(B_n\)</span>
            . The root
                <span class="math">\(M_n\)</span>
             of the MMR MUST be included in the header of
                <span class="math">\(B_n\)</span>
            .</p>
            <p>(
                <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
             is the activation height of the preceding network upgrade.)</p>
            <p>FlyClient reduces the number of block headers needed for light client verification of a valid chain, from linear (as in the current reference protocol) to logarithmic in block chain length. This verification is correct with high probability. It also allows creation of subtree proofs, so light clients need only check blocks later than the most recently verified block index. Following that, verification of a transaction inclusion within that block follows the usual reference protocol <a id="id6" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0307">11</a>.</p>
            <p>A smaller proof size could enable the verification of Zcash SPV Proofs in block-chain protocols such as Ethereum, enabling efficient cross-chain communication and pegs. It also reduces bandwidth and storage requirements for resource-limited clients like mobile or IoT devices.</p>

            <p>For a block

             at height
                <span class="math">\(n &gt; 0\)</span>
             in a given block chain, define the "preceding network upgrade height"
                <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
             of
                <span class="math">\(B_n\)</span>

                <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
            . (For this definion, block height
                <span class="math">\(0\)</span>
             is considered to be the height of a network upgrade activation. The preceding network upgrade height of the genesis block is undefined.)</p>
            <p>The leaves of the MMR at block
                <span class="math">\(B_n\)</span>
             are hash commitments to the header data and metadata of each previous block
                <span class="math">\(B_x, \ldots, B_{n-1}\)</span>
            , where
                <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
             is defined as above. We extend the standard MMR to allow metadata to propagate upwards through the tree by either summing the metadata of both children, or inheriting the metadata of a specific child as necessary. This allows us to create efficient proofs of selected properties of a range of blocks without transmitting the entire range of blocks or headers.</p>

                <p>The <code>hashFinalSaplingRoot</code> block header field (which was named <code>hashReserved</code> prior to the Sapling network upgrade) is renamed to <code>hashLightClientRoot</code>, to reflect its usage by light clients.</p>
                <p>Prior to activation of the Heartwood network upgrade, this existing consensus rule on block headers (adjusted for the renamed field) is enforced: <a id="id10" class="footnote_reference" href="#block-header">4</a></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>[Sapling onward] <code>hashLightClientRoot</code> MUST be
                        <span class="math">\(\mathsf{LEBS2OSP}_{256}(\mathsf{rt})\)</span>
                     where
                        <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rt}\)</span>
                     is the root of the Sapling note commitment tree for the final Sapling tree state of this block.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Once the Heartwood network upgrade activates, <code>hashLightClientRoot</code> MUST be set to the value of <code>hashChainHistoryRoot</code> as specified above.</p>
                <p>The above specification is not well-defined for the genesis block, since then
                    <span class="math">\(n = 0\)</span>
                 and there is no block

                . For the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet chains, this is not an issue because the Heartwood network upgrade is not active at genesis. In the case of this specification being adopted for a chain that starts with Heartwood active at genesis, the <code>hashLightClientRoot</code> field of the genesis block for that chain MUST be set to all zero bytes.</p>
                <p>The block header byte format and version are not altered by this ZIP.</p>

                <p>Nodes in the commitment tree are canonical and immutable. They are cheap to generate, as (with the exception of <code>nSaplingTxCount</code>) all metadata is already generated during block construction and/or checked during block validation. Nodes are relatively compact in memory. Approximately 140,000 blocks have elapsed since Sapling activation. Assuming a 164 byte commitment to each of these, we would have generated approximately 24 MB of additional storage cost for the set of leaf nodes (and an additional ~24 MB for storage of intermediate nodes).</p>
                <p><code>hashSubtreeCommitment</code> forms the strucuture of the commitment tree. Other metadata commitments were chosen to serve specific purposes. Variable-length commitments are placed last, so that most metadata in a node can be directly indexed. We considered using fixed-length commitments here, but opted for variable-length, in order to marginally reduce the memory requirements for managing and updating the commitment trees.</p>
                <p>In leaf nodes, some information is repeated. We chose to do this so that leaf nodes could be treated identically to internal and root nodes for all algorithms and (de)serializers. Leaf nodes are easily identifiable, as they will show proof of work in the <code>hashSubtreeCommitment</code> field (which commits to the block hash for leaf nodes), and their block range (calculated as <code>nLatestHeight</code> - (<code>nEarliestHeight</code> - 1)) will be precisely 1.</p>
                <p>Personalized BLAKE2b-256 was selected to match existing Zcash conventions. Adding the consensus branch ID to the hash personalization string ensures that valid nodes from one consensus branch cannot be used to make false statements about parallel consensus branches.</p>

                    <p>These commitments enable FlyClient in the variable-difficulty model. Specifically, they allow light clients to reason about application of the difficulty adjustment algorithm over a range of blocks. They were chosen via discussion with an author of the FlyClient paper.</p>

                    <p>Additional metadata commitments were chosen primarily to improve light client security guarantees. We specified commitments where we could see an obvious security benefit, but there may be other useful metadata that we missed. We're interested in feedback and suggestions from the implementers of the current light client.</p>
                    <p>We considered adding a commitment to the nullifier vector at each block. We would appreciate comments from light client teams on the utility of this commitment, as well as the proper serialization and commitment format for the nullifier vector.</p>

                        <li><code>hashEarliestSaplingRoot</code>

                                <li>Committing to the earliest Sapling root of a range of blocks allows light clients to check the consistency of treestate transitions over a range of blocks, without recalculating the root from genesis.</li>

                        </li>

                                <li>This commitment serves the same purpose as <code>hashFinalSaplingRoot</code> in current Sapling semantics.</li>
                                <li>However, because the MMR tree commits to blocks
                                    <span class="math">\(B_x \ldots B_{n-1}\)</span>
                                , the latest commitment will describe the final treestate of the previous block, rather than the current block.</li>
                                <li>Concretely: block 500 currently commits to the final treestate of block 500 in its header. With this ZIP, block 500 will commit to all roots up to block 499, but not the final root of block 500.</li>
                                <li>We feel this is an acceptable tradeoff. Using the most recent treestate as a transaction anchor is already unsafe in reorgs. Clients should never use the most recent treestate to generate transactions, so it is acceptable to delay commitment by one block.</li>

                                <li>By committing to the number of Sapling transactions in blocks (and ranges of blocks), a light client may reliably learn whether a malicious server is witholding any Sapling transactions.</li>
                                <li>In addition, this commitment allows light clients to avoid syncing header ranges that do not contain Sapling transactions. As the primary cost of a light client is transmission of Equihash solution information in block headers, this optimization would significantly decrease the bandwidth requirements of light clients.</li>
                                <li>An earlier draft of this ZIP committed to the number of shielded transactions, counting both Sprout and Sapling. This commitment would not have been useful to light clients that only support Sapling addresses; they would not be able to distinguish between Sapling transactions being maliciously withheld, and Sprout transactions not being requested.</li>
                                <li>A commitment to the number of Sprout transactions in blocks was not included, because Sprout addresses are effectively deprecated at this point, and will not be supported by any light clients.</li>
                                <li>If a future network upgrade introduced a new shielded pool, a new commitment to that pool's transactions would be added, to similarly enable future light clients that do not support Sapling addresses.</li>

                <p>The primary goal of the original authors was to minimize header changes; in particular, they preferred not to introduce changes that could affect mining hardware or embedded software. Altering the block header format would require changes throughout the ecosystem, so we decided against adding <code>hashChainHistoryRoot</code> to the header as a new field.</p>
                <p>ZIP 301 states that "[Miner client software] SHOULD alert the user upon receiving jobs containing block header versions they do not know about or support, and MUST ignore such jobs." <a id="id11" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0301">10</a> As the only formally defined block header version is 4, any header version change requires changes to miner client software in order for miners to handle new jobs from mining pools. We therefore do not alter the block version for this semantic change. This does not make block headers ambiguous to interpret, because blocks commit to their block height inside their coinbase transaction, <a id="id12" class="footnote_reference" href="#bip-0034">7</a> and they are never handled in a standalone context (unlike transactions, which exist in the mempool outside of blocks).</p>
                <p>Replacing <code>hashFinalSaplingRoot</code> with <code>hashChainHistoryRoot</code> does introduce the theoretical possibility of an attack where a miner constructs a Sapling commitment tree update that results in the same 32-byte value as the MMR root. We don't consider this a realistic attack, both because the adversary would need to find a preimage over 32 layers of Pedersen hash, and because light clients already need to update their code to include the consensus branch ID for the Heartwood network upgrade, and can simultaneously make changes to not rely on the value of this header field being the Sapling tree root.</p>
                <p>We also considered putting <code>hashChainHistoryRoot</code> in the <code>hashPrevBlock</code> field as it commits to the entire chain history, but quickly realized it would require massive refactoring of the existing code base and would negatively impact performance. Reorgs in particular are fragile, performance-critical, and rely on backwards iteration over the chain history. If a chain were to be designed from scratch there may be some efficient implementation that would join these commitments, but it is clearly not appropriate for Zcash as it exists.</p>

        <section id="security-and-privacy-considerations"><h2><span class="section-heading">Security and Privacy Considerations</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a href="#security-and-privacy-considerations"><img width="24" height="24" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>This ZIP imposes an additional validation cost on new blocks. While this validation cost is small, it may exacerbate any existing DoS opportunities, particularly during abnormal events like long reorgs. Fortunately, these costs are logarithmic in the number of delete and append operations. In the worst case scenario, a well-resourced attacker could maintain 2 chains of approximately equal length, and alternate which chain they extend. This would result in repeated reorgs of increasing length.</p>
            <p>Given the performance of BLAKE2b, we expect this validation cost to be negligible. However, it seems prudent to benchmark potential MMR implementations during the implementation process. Should the validation cost be higher than expected, there are several potential mitigations, e.g. holding recently seen nodes in memory after a reorg.</p>
            <p>Generally, header commitments have no impact on privacy. However, FlyClient has additional security and privacy implications. Because FlyClient is a motivating factor for this ZIP, it seems prudent to include a brief overview. A more in-depth security analysis of FlyClient should be performed before designing a FlyClient-based light client ecosystem for Zcash.</p>
            <p>FlyClient, like all light clients, requires a connection to a light client server. That server may collect information about client requests, and may use that information to attempt to deanonymize clients. However, because FlyClient proofs are non-interactive and publicly verifiable, they could be shared among many light clients after the initial server interaction.</p>
            <p>FlyClient proofs are probabilistic. When properly constructed, there is negligible probability that a dishonest chain commitment will be accepted by the verifier. The security analysis assumes adversary mining power is bounded by a known fraction of combined mining power of honest nodes, and cannot drop or tamper with messages between client and full nodes. It also assumes the client is connected to at least one full node and knows the genesis block. However, these security properties have not been examined closely in chain models with rapidly adjusting difficulty.</p>
