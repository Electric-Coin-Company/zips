  Title: Split Founders' Reward

Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_


Abstract
========

This proposal defines how the consensus rules are altered to split the original Founders' Reward across
several recipient addresses per block instead of one, corresponding to the several funding streams contained
within it.


Motivation
==========

Since the launch of the Zcash network, the consensus rules have required that until the first block reward
halving (at block 850,000), each block must send 20% of the block subsidy to a hard-coded transparent address.
[#block-subsidy]_ This funding stream is referred to as the Founders' Reward.

This stream of 2.5-ZEC outputs (the value after the mining slow-start was completed) can be split into several
logical funding streams (for background, see [#continued-funding]_). Modifying the consensus rules to allocate
the 2.5 ZEC across separate recipient addresses decouples these funding streams organizationally, legally, and
operationally. It further reinforces transparency as to the structure of the original Founders' Reward.


Specification
=============

Definitions
-----------

We use the following constants and functions defined in [#zip-0208]_:

- ``BlossomActivationHeight``
- ``PostBlossomHalvingInterval``
- ``Halving(height)``

We also define the following constants and functions:

- ``SlowStartShift`` as-defined in [#block-subsidy]_.
- ``HeightForHalving(halving)``: Smallest ``height`` such that ``Halving(height) = halving``

Funding streams
---------------

A funding stream is defined by a block reward fraction (represented as a numerator and a denominator), a start
height (inclusive), and an end height (exclusive).

By defining the issuance as a proportion of the total block issuance, rather than absolute zatoshis, this ZIP
dovetails with any changes to both block target times and issuance-per-block rates while maintaining an
unchanged target-time-based issuance schedule. We anticipate such target-time / issuance rate changes in other
ZIPs (for example, [#zip-0208]_).

The value of a funding stream at a given block height is defined as::

    FundingStream[FUND].Value(height) =
        floor((
            BlockReward(height) * FundingStream[FUND].ValueNumerator
        ) / FundingStream[FUND].ValueDenominator)

An active funding stream at a given block height is defined as a funding stream for which the block height is
less than its end height, but not less than its start height.

Each funding stream has an associated set of recipient addresses. Each address is used for at most 1/48th of a
halving interval, creating a roughly-monthly sequence of funding periods. The address to be used for a given
block height is defined as follows::

    AddressChangeInterval = PostBlossomHalvingInterval / 48
    AddressPeriod(height) =
        floor((
            height + PostBlossomHalvingInterval - HeightForHalving(1)
        ) / AddressChangeInterval)
    FundingStream[FUND].AddressIndex(height) =
        AddressPeriod(height) - AddressPeriod(FundingStream[FUND].StartHeight)
    Address(height) = FundingStream[FUND].Addresses[FundingStream[FUND].AddressIndex(height)]

This has the property that all active funding streams change the address they are using on the same block
height schedule, aligned to the height of the first halving so that 48 funding periods fit cleanly within a
halving interval. This can be leveraged to simplify implementations, by batching the necessary outputs for
each funding period.

Below is a visual representation of how stream addresses align with funding periods:

================================== ======== ======== ========
          Example height           Stream A Stream B Stream C
================================== ======== ======== ========
     ``AddressChangeInterval - 2``    A0
     ``AddressChangeInterval - 1``    A0
     ``AddressChangeInterval``        A1       B0       C0
     ``AddressChangeInterval + 1``    A1       B0       C0
             ...
   ``2*AddressChangeInterval - 2``    A1       B0       C0
   ``2*AddressChangeInterval - 1``    A1       B0       C0
   ``2*AddressChangeInterval``        A2                C1
   ``2*AddressChangeInterval + 1``    A2                C1
             ...
``PostBlossomHalvingInterval - 2``    A2                C1
``PostBlossomHalvingInterval - 1``    A2                C1
``PostBlossomHalvingInterval``                          C2
``PostBlossomHalvingInterval + 1``                      C2
================================== ======== ======== ========

Note that this is not intended to align with the end of a pre-Blossom Founders' Reward address period (as
defined by ``FounderAddressChangeInterval`` in [#original-fr-consensus-rule]_). There will be a shortened
Founders' Reward address period prior to Blossom activation.

Consensus rules
---------------

Prior to activation of the Blossom network upgrade, the existing consensus rule for payment of the original
Founders' Reward is enforced. [#original-fr-consensus-rule]_

Once the Blossom network upgrade activates:

- The existing consensus rule [#original-fr-consensus-rule]_ is no longer active.
- The coinbase transaction in each block MUST contain at least one output per active funding stream that pays
  the stream's value to the stream's recipient address for the block's height.

Stream definitions
------------------

The consensus-defined funding streams described above each start at the Blossom activation height, and end at
the first block reward halving. They are defined as follows:

====== =============== ================= =========================== =======================
Stream Value numerator Value denominator        Start height               End height
====== =============== ================= =========================== =======================
 FS 1         3                40        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 2         1                25        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 3         1                40        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 4         1                50        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 5         1                80        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 6         1                80        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 7         1               100        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
 FS 8         1               200        ``BlossomActivationHeight`` ``HeightForHalving(1)``
====== =============== ================= =========================== =======================

- To-do: specify the correct values.

The sum of the block reward fractions for the above funding streams is ``1/5``, equal to the original
Founders' Reward (as-defined by ``FoundersFraction`` in [#protocol-constants]_).

The sets of recipient addresses are defined as follows:

Deployment
==========

This proposal will be deployed with the Blossom network upgrade. [#zip-0XXX]_


Backward compatibility
======================

This proposal intentionally creates what is known as a "bilateral consensus rule change". Use of this
mechanism requires that all network participants upgrade their software to a compatible version within the
upgrade window. Older software will treat post-upgrade blocks as invalid, and will follow any pre-upgrade
branch that persists.

This proposal is designed with the explicit requirement of not altering the overall issuance schedule (based
on time), nor does it alter the proportion or timeline of the overall Founders' Reward. As a result, no users
outside of the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation should experience any UX or economic change
outside of the upgrade due to this proposal itself.


Interactions with other ZIPs
----------------------------

[#zip-0208]_ (Shorter Block Target Spacing) specifies a change to the block target spacing. It is planned
to take effect in the Blossom network upgrade [#zip-0206]_. This ZIP was originally written to take effect
at the same time, but was Withdrawn from consideration for Blossom.

ZIP 208 modifies the payment of the original Founders' Reward to take account of the block target spacing
change. It does this by specifying a FounderAddressAdjustedHeight function and related changes, which would
need to be revisited to take into account funding streams.
